It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foo1ishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredu1ity,
it was the season of 1ight,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the minter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were a11 going direct to Heaven,
we were a11 going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far 1ike the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evi1, in the super1ative degree of comparison on1y.
